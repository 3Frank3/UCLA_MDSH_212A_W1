## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(gtsummary)
library(ISLR2)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# Convert to tibble
Wage<- as_tibble(Wage)%>%
  print(width=Inf)

# Summary Statistics
Wage %>% tbl_summary()
```

```{r}
# Plot wage ~ age
Wage %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age, y = wage)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Wage changes nonlinearly with age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Wage (k$)")
```
